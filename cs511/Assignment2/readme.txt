Gym Simulation - a study of semaphores

Compile the code with "javac Assignment.java" and run “java Assignment2” to start the simulation.

The simulation normally does nothing, but I added some print statements so you are able to observe the different Clients and their access/release of the machines. The program handles in the area of 10,000 clients, but it is currently set to 100. I’ve commented the code in Gym.java where you can increase the number if you’d like.

Let me know what you think.
