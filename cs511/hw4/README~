This is a project to show off the power of Erlang.
There are a number of watchers that can observe 10 sensors. The sensors are simple - they live and die generating random numbers up to 11.
The watcher is responsible for reading from the sensor and restarting a sensor if it dies. It manages the id of the sensors it watches and maintains the place of the sensor in the array of sensors
