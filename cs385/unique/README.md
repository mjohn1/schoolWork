Unique Letters project

Given a string of letters, find if all the letters are unique in the string (e.g. they have only occured once). The catch, a single int was the only variable we could use for storing letter occurences. This utilizes bitwise operations and only one pass of the string to find our answer.

Pretty cool, huh?
