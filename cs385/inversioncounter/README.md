Inversion Counter project

Classic Merge Sort exercise. The project finds inversions in an array with two algorithms. The first algorithm runs in theta(n^2) while the second uses merge sort and runs in theta(n lg n).
Inversions represent the steps needed to sort the array; a perfectly sorted array has 0 inversions, while an array that is sorted in reverse has the maximum number of inversions.
